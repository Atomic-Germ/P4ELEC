Born from the want to have a better experience for my **Panel 4 v5 R36s** handheld, and discovering various features not working, along with a lack of support from AmberELEC, this Unofficial build and fan edit specifically tackles issues myself and other owners have faced, along with adding some new features and quality of life upgrades.

and from that, and guessing the AmberELEC guys may not want to support it, due to time and the various projects they are split across, there's also a version for the **BATLEXP G350**.

I encouraged you to support the [AmberELEC](https://amberelec.org/) developers for their foundational work, and bringing such a stable base to the community to play, work and build upon.
