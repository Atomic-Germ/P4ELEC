Here you will find the specific changes I have made to AmberELEC for the R36s Panel 4 and G350.

This may not line up with their source code extactly, and there will be personal elements, like artwork and personal apps I have made, that will not shared. For things like that you can go through the trouble of unsquashing the SYSTEM image and pull that from there.

Equally the likes of code changes to dtb's I have created for PAN4ELEC will not be shared as these were decompiled and adapted from the stock dtb's that came with the hardwares OS.
